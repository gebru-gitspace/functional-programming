# Rust Functional Programming Concepts

A compact Rust project demonstrating **functional programming paradigms** with idiomatic Rust code. This project emphasizes pure functions, closures, recursion, composition, pattern matching, and the builder pattern.

---

## Features

- **Pure Functions:** Functions with no side-effects and predictable outputs.
- **Lambda & Closures:** Anonymous functions and closures capturing the environment.
- **Map, Filter, and Fold:** Functional transformations and reductions using iterators.
- **Recursion:** Example of factorial computation.
- **Function Composition & Currying:** Combining functions and returning partial functions.
- **Partial Application:** Fixing arguments to create specialized functions.
- **Pattern Matching & Enums:** Algebraic data types and `match`-based evaluation.
- **Builder Pattern:** Immutable builder pattern for struct construction.
- **Option Handling:** Safe handling of potentially missing data.
